# This is a C++20 project
The RSA implementation contains a few components
* SHA512 hash function
* Pseudo random number generator (uses SHA512)
* Prime number generator (using boost::multiprecision::miller_rabin)
* RSA public private key pair generator
# rsa_cpp
Simple RSA Implementation\
Uses boost::endian and boost::multiprecision::cpp_int

# Simplicity Is The First Step To Security
It doesn't have to be complicated.
