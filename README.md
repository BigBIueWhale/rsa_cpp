# WIP
This is a work in progress, so far it's only SHA512 and it's not even tested very well.\
Currently produces wrong hash for the ASCII string:\
"hello worldalskjdfhlkashdf;oie lasdjhf we fiauh lkuh aiuwe hviuahei aawe hadoi hweiqwe[qe[]qasdfasdfsdfdsffdshgjtasdfas"\
and in fact for any string between with a length in bytes in the range [112, 120]
# rsa_cpp
Simple RSA Implementation\
Uses boost::endian and boost::multiprecision::cpp_int

# Simplicity Is The First Step To Security
It doesn't have to be complicated.
